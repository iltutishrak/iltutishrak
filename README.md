I build reasoning-driven AI systems, focusing on orchestration, evaluation, governance, and explainability.  
I believe the best AI PMs do more than write PRDs. They prototype, test, and iterate.

### 🚀 What I Build
| Area | Focus |
|------|--------|
| 🧩 **Agentic Systems** | multi-agent orchestration, planning, simulation |
| 📊 **Evaluation and Reliability** | LLM trust scoring, hallucination detection, reasoning metrics |
| 🧠 **Governance and Feedback** | bias audits, HITL loops, model transparency |
| 🧰 **PM Frameworks** | reusable templates and metrics guides for AI teams |
